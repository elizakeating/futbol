# Futbol

## Project Summary
- The Futbol project uses data from a fictional soccer league to analyze team performance for specific seasons and across seasons. The Stat Tracker class returns many statistics for each game, season and league.

## Plan Summary
- We plan to check in everyday during our work time.
- On Friday we will assess whether or not we need to meet during the weekend.
- At the end of the project, we decided to work most of Saturday to finish the Stat Tracker class and verify Spec Harness was working for all tests and decided who would present each section for the evaluation.

## Workflow Plan
- We will be using a [Trello](https://trello.com/b/VVJuBHIM/futbol-project) board to keep track of what needs to be done. We will also be able to assign methods to specific people in order to divide the workload up.
- The team utilized Slack to keep in good contact and keep all other team members updated on our progress.

## Project Organization
- We took the first night to brainstorm on our own about how we wanted to organize the project. We then had a discussion and determined we were going to split our project into Game Statistic, League Statistic, and Season Statistic classes. We also discussed possibly refactoring repeated methods into a module.
- At the end of the project we decided to work on the Stat Tracker class together and decided that we wouldn't need a module based on each class having the methodolgy needed to pass the Spec tests.

## Code Design
- We are going to have three different classes that are split by similar types of statistics. Inside of these classes we will have their respective methods. Once we have these methods and classes implemented the way that we want we will think about refactoring repeated methods into a module.
- At the end of the project we decided that we would not need a Module for our classes and decided to put all logic within the classes themselves.
